## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?

- I much prefer to do things with people than to talk about things; I suck at conversation but am somewhat competent at doing things.
- I'd much rather talk about you than myself, I love learning new things about people!
- If I get interested in a problem, I keep working at it even if I'm working in the wrong direction; I've been known to spend hours on a crossword puzzle. This also means I can get deep into a rabbit hole that is incorrect
- I'm pretty strongly opinionated about a lot of things, but I'm open to changing my mind on literally anything. I change my mind a lot.

### What drives you nuts?

- Unclear expectations
- Bikeshedding
- Burying the lede, I prefer things short and concise

### What are your quirks?

- I have a very low battery but I burn super bright, so don't be surprised if I'm super lively one minute and then completely dead the next.
- I'm down to do anything at least once, even if I know I won't like it.
- I have a pretty short attention span; my brain has been fully cooked by Twitter TikTok and Instagram

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

- I'm quite awkward and have a resting cranky face, so I might come off as always upset, but I promise I'm friendly!

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?

- Being strongly opinionated on things. I love when people have well thought out, strongly thought out positions.
- Decisiveness, even if the decision ends up being wrong, I value the effort and follow through

### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?

- Non feedback. If you have any complaints about the way I work, I would strongly prefer that you tell me directly and ASAP!
- Committing to things that they aren't able to do

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?

- Being a self starter!
- Having big goals, thinking large

## About my interactions

### What’s the best way to communicate with you?

- Be up front and clear what you want from me, BLUF and TLDR it all the way!
- Metrics, numbers speak to me much better than words do

### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?

- I'm very vulnerable to getting nerd sniped, so if you give me an interesting problem, odds are that I'll try to solve it. 

### How do you like to give feedback?

- I'm pretty honest with both positive and negative feedback, just ask! I don't have a great memory though, so preferably soon after we've worked together.

### How do you like to get feedback?

- After anytime I've worked with you. In the moment preferably.
- In the form "I didn't enjoy how you did this, please do this specific thing instead next time".
